## Modules

The framework relies on one module only which is Pester. Pester drives the unit testing results, by invoking Pester and feeding the json files to TS_AutomatedTests.ps1.

## Additional Modules

In the modules folder, you can place any other modules you want the framework to use for its unit testing.
